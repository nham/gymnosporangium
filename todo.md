 - TESTS
 - kosaraju strongly connceted components
 - topological sorting (use CLRS, look at Skiena)
 - testing if a dag is cyclic (back edges? look at DFS)
 - minimum spanning tree (networkx uses kruskal)
 - tarjans strongly connected components algorithm?
 - graph isomorphism algorithm. probably vf2
 - tree isomorphism algorithm. AHU!
 - Prim's algorithm? what even is it
 - Dijkstra's algorithm
 - Bellman-Ford
 - Stoer-Wagner min-cut
 - floyd-warshall
 - stuff about bipartite graphs?
 - Huffman codes?
